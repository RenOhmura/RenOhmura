I'm Ren Ohmura, an associate professor at the Toyohashi University of Technology (TUT), Japan.
Also, I'm a principal investigator (PI) of the ubiquitous systems laboratory (USL) at TUT.
My research interest is ubiquitous computing technologies, and thus very wide, from system software for cloud services to AI applications on mobiles!
